## Linear Regression

### Overview
In this section, we implement linear regression using the mean square error (MSE) on the winequality-red dataset. The steps include data preprocessing, feature selection, division into training and testing sets, and applying the closed-form solution for linear regression.

### Dataset
- The winequality-red dataset consists of 12 columns, including attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and quality.

### Implementation Steps
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Create Data Matrices
- Split Dataset
- Closed-Form Solution for Linear Regression
- Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Plot Predictions vs. Actual Data

## Logistic Regression

### Overview
In this section, we implement logistic regression on the penguins dataset. The goal is to use a logistic function to model binary or multiclass classification tasks. The steps include data preprocessing, feature selection, training the logistic regression model, and evaluating accuracy.

### Dataset
- The penguins dataset contains information about penguin species, measurements, island names, and gender.

### Implementation Steps
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Create Data Matrices
- Split Dataset
- Implement Logistic Regression
- Calculate Accuracy
- Plot Loss Over Iterations
- Experiment with Hyperparameters
